      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this assignment was to step into a user's shoes. I observed real users interacting with an 
        interface, interviewed these individuals about their experiences, created personas based on these users, and 
        illustrated a storyboard for one of these personas.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="prep" style="margin: 50px;">
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <h4>Selecting an Interface</h4>
      <p>
        I chose the CVS pharmacy self checkout kiosk as my interface for observation. This is an interface that I 
        interact with on a fairly frequent basis, so I've exoperience just about every problem it has to offer.
        Self checktout interfaces also tend to have a wide variety of users which makes them a perfect subject to 
        observe.
      </p>
      <h4>Interview Questions</h4>
      <p>
        In order to effectively create these personas, I needed to craft stimulating yet objective questions for 
        users regarding their experiences with the interface:
      </p>
        <div class="card" style="max-width: 600px; margin: auto">
          <div class="card-body lead">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>How many items did you purchase and what were they?</li>
              <li>Have you ever used a self-checkout before?</li>
              <li>Did you find this more convenient than regular checkout? Why or why not?</li>
              <li>Did you use any paper coupons?</li>
              <li>Did you experience any difficulties scanning your items?</li>
              <li>How old are you?</li>
              <li>Do you have a CVS card? If so, were there any issues aplying your benefits?</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
      <h4>Interface Sketches</h4>
      <p>
        Next, I created two hand drawn sketches that annotate the key interactive components of the kiosk.
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
          <div class="col">
            <img src="./images/interface sketch.jpg" style="border: 1px solid; border-color: black;">
            <p>
              Sketch of the entire body of the physical system
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <img src="./images/interface screen.jpg" style="border: 1px solid; border-color: black;">
            <p>
              Sketch of the various screens in the interface in order of operation
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="observe" style="margin: 50px;">
      <h2>Recording Observations</h2>
      <h4>Observing Users</h4>
      <p>
        I observed 3 people using the interface. During this phase, I paid careful attention to how each user 
        interacted with the interface and made objective observations about their actions. This is a summary of key 
        interactions I noticed:
        <ul>
          <li> Users with larger items often search around for a handheld barcode scanner </li>
          <li> 
            Some users experienced confusion after entering their cvs account number because the discounts were not 
            applied immediately 
          </li>
          <li>Confusion on where to place items that were already scanned</li>
          <li>Confusion on which button to hit for payment</li>
          <li>Some users had to spend a few moments searching for the barcode on their item before scanning</li>
          <li>General confusion after scanning items because of the skip bagging prompt</li>

        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Interviewing Users</h4>
      <p>
        After making my initial observations, I personally interviewed these users with the questions I created to 
        build material to create my personas. This is a summary of the interview responses:
      </p>
      <div class="card" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto">
        <div class="card-body lead">
          <ol type="1">
            <li class="list-item">How many items did you purchase and what were they?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Snacks & general food items</li>
              <li>Medicine</li>
              <li>Around 5 or less items</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Have you ever used a self-checkout before?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All participants answered yes</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Did you find this more convenient than regular checkout? Why or why not?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Yes, because I avoided speaking to the cashier</li>
              <li>Yes, I can control the speed at which I checkout</li>
              <li>No, issues with the interface delayed my checkout</li>
              <li>Yes, the self-checkout was already open whereas there was no available cashier</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Did you use any paper coupons?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All participants answered no</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Did you experience any difficulties scanning your items?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Yes, scanning larger items was difficult without a handheld scanner. I had to lift it up.</li>
              <li>The weight sensor was annoying, it slowed down my process</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">How old are you?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Generally late teens to early 20s (it's a college town)</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Do you have a CVS card? If so, were there any issues aplying your benefits?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Yes, I do. I didn't experience any issues</li>
              <li>Yes, I do. I was confused when my discounts weren't applied immediately. I had to completely checkout before they showed up.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

    <div id="personas" style="margin: 50px;">
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        The next step in analyzing this interface was to take the data I collected from my observations and 
        interviews and use it to create two personas. The personas are be based on overarching trends I observed 
        amongst all the users I interviewed, not characteristics from a specific individual. Below are the empathy maps
        I used to construct these personas:
      </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <iframe src="./assets/personas.pdf" width="75%" height="800px" style="margin: 20px"></iframe>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="storyboard" style="margin: 50px;">
      <h2>Storyboard</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, I used one of my personas to create a storyboard for this hypothetical user. This storyboard is
        intended to reflect the goals of the persona and include the necessary steps for using the CVS self checkout
        interface
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
        <img src="./images/storyboard.jpg" style="max-width: 80%; border: 1px solid; border-color: grey;">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="reflection" style="margin: 50px;">
      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        This assignment really helped me understand how to get into the mind of a user when designing a product.
        Knowing your audience is key to designing effective products, and the idea of creating an empathy map allows
        you to personify this hypothetical audience!
